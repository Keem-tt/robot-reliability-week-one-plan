# Week-One Impact Plan

## Overview

In my first week, I would focus on establishing order, safety, and repeatability in the lab environment so that reliability testing and troubleshooting can proceed efficiently. The plan centres on five key tracks: **organization and 5S**, **calibration and preventive maintenance**, **reliability test planning**, **documentation**, and **communication**.

## 1. 5S & Organization

- **Map the lab** and identify zones for FDM printers, electrical benches, tools, consumables, and test rigs.
- **Create shadow boards and QR‑coded bins** so every tool and part has a clearly labeled home and can be found and returned quickly.
- **Implement daily end‑of‑shift tidy and restock routines** to maintain a clean and efficient workspace.

## 2. Calibration & Preventive Maintenance

- **Inventory all equipment** (FDM printers, soldering stations, power supplies, multimeters, torque drivers, helium setups, etc.) and create a calibration/maintenance log with due dates and responsible owners.
- **Standardize checks for FDM printers**: bed leveling, extruder steps, belt tension; and establish a schedule for nozzle replacement and filament spool rotation.
- **Ensure measuring instruments** (calipers, microscopes, scales) are calibrated and logged.

## 3. Reliability Test Planning

- **Meet with the engineering team** to define target lifetimes and failure modes for key assemblies (motors, gearboxes, wiring harnesses, connectors, and FDM‑printed parts).
- **Draft a test matrix** covering component‑level and subassembly‑level tests, including thermal cycling, mechanical fatigue, vibration, and environmental stress screening appropriate for FDM materials and electrical assemblies.
- **Begin building simple fixtures and data logging scripts** to run these tests, starting with high‑risk components.

## 4. Version‑controlled Fixtures & SOPs

- **Set up a Git repository** under the team’s organization to store fixture designs, test scripts, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
- **Write template SOPs** for common tasks (calibrating a printer, starting a reliability test, troubleshooting a failed board), emphasizing clarity and reproducibility.
- **Use version control** to track changes and improvements.

## 5. Communication & Reporting

- **Establish a daily stand‑up** with cross‑functional partners (electrical, mechanical, reliability engineers) to share findings and priorities.
- **Create a dashboard or shared document** to track open issues, ongoing tests, and results.
- **Provide a short end‑of‑week read‑out** on progress, obstacles, and next steps.

By focusing on these areas in the first week, I can lay the groundwork for a disciplined, data‑driven reliability program while freeing the team to iterate quickly.
